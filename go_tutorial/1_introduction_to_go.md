# Introduction to Go

## What is Go?

Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source programming language developed by Google in 2007 and officially released in 2009. It was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson (the creator of Unix and C) to address the challenges of building large-scale, concurrent software systems.

## History and Development

### Origins
- **2007**: Development began at Google
- **2009**: First public release (Go 1.0)
- **2012**: Go 1.0 officially released with stability guarantee
- **Present**: Active development with regular releases

### Design Philosophy
Go was designed with these principles in mind:
- **Simplicity**: Clean, readable syntax
- **Efficiency**: Fast compilation and execution
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for concurrent programming
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management
- **Static Typing**: Compile-time type checking
- **Cross-platform**: Write once, run anywhere

## Why Go?

### Problems Go Solves
1. **Slow Compilation**: Traditional languages like C++ can take hours to compile large projects
2. **Complex Dependencies**: Managing dependencies in large projects
3. **Concurrent Programming**: Making concurrent programming easier and safer
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Simplifying the deployment process
5. **Development Speed**: Faster development cycles

### Key Design Decisions
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management
- **No Inheritance**: Composition over inheritance

## Installing Go

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Disk Space**: At least 1GB free space
- **Internet Connection**: For downloading Go and packages

### Installation Methods

#### 1. Official Installer (Recommended)
**Windows:**
1. Download from https://golang.org/dl/
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install go

# Or download from https://golang.org/dl/
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install golang

# Or download from https://golang.org/dl/
```

#### 2. Manual Installation
```bash
# Download and extract
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add to PATH
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Verifying Installation
```bash
go version
# Output: go version go1.21.0 linux/amd64
```

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. GOPATH and GOROOT
- **GOROOT**: Go installation directory (usually `/usr/local/go`)
- **GOPATH**: Your Go workspace (usually `~/go`)

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

### 3. Go Modules (Go 1.11+)
Modern Go development uses modules instead of GOPATH:
```bash
# Initialize a new module
go mod init myproject

# Add dependencies
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy
```

## Your First Go Program

### Hello World
Create a file named `main.go`:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Running the Program
```bash
# Run directly
go run main.go

# Build executable
go build main.go
./main

# Build for different platforms
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
```
